2) Xpath for various object kept changing, Hence changes in code were to be made very frequently.
3) Stale Element Reference Exception was coming so we used try catch for that.
4) Implementing Maven and Jenkins was for first created minor issues during execution.


Things that could have better:
Price slider in the used site was supposed to be set at 15,000 but the slider is being set at 15,220. So for the slider value can be set to exact value that would have been better.
